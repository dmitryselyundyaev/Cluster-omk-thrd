Now CNC operator have big problem with saving their parameters and terrible paper work.This app was made only for operator's comfort, but it turned out we can get big economy effect on this. 

- When we start saving parameters we reduce time for setup , defect's on setup and tool's wear. Now we're trying to collect more data to keep it up.

- The statistic we get from this is really helpful. Because we can measure machine geometry and prevent critical moments.
